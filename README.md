# Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive **Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis Dashboard** built using **Tableau**. The dashboard utilizes a sample dataset to provide valuable insights into EV adoption, market trends, and environmental impact.


## Project Overview

The EV Analysis Dashboard aims to:
- Visualize trends in EV adoption based on vehicle registration data.
- Highlight geographic distribution of electric vehicle usage across counties and cities.
- Analyze the relationship between EV types, battery ranges, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.
- Provide insights into manufacturers, models, and EV market growth over time.
