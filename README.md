# Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive **Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis Dashboard** built using **Tableau**. The dashboard utilizes a sample dataset to provide valuable insights into EV adoption, market trends, and environmental impact.


## Project Overview

The EV Analysis Dashboard aims to:
- Visualize trends in EV adoption based on vehicle registration data.
- Highlight geographic distribution of electric vehicle usage across counties and cities.
- Analyze the relationship between EV types, battery ranges, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.
- Provide insights into manufacturers, models, and EV market growth over time.

## Features

- **Geographic Analysis**: Understand the distribution of EV registrations across counties and cities.
- **Electric Vehicle Types**: Compare Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
- **Eligibility Insights**: Analyze how CAFV eligibility correlates with electric range and vehicle specifications.
- **Brand Performance**: Explore popular manufacturers and their contributions to EV adoption.
- **Yearly Trends**: Discover trends in model years and EV registrations.



## Tools and Technologies

- **Tableau**: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Data Sources**: Sample dataset containing details about electric vehicle registrations in Washington state.
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed in **Excel** and **SQL** to prepare the data for visualization.
